 * Signatures for the leaving card.
 *
 * To sign: add a new object to the END of the SIGNATURES array below, then
 * open a pull request. See SIGNING.md for the full guide.
 *
 * Each entry supports:
 *   name      (required)  Your name, as you want it signed.
 *   message   (required)  Your message. Use \n for a line break.
 *   role      (optional)  A short line under your name, e.g. "Platform team".
 *   font      (optional)  One of the named fonts in SIGNATURE_FONTS (card.js).
 *   colour    (optional)  Any CSS colour, e.g. "#1a3a6b" or "teal".

 *   size      (optional)  Text size in rem, roughly 1.2 to 2.0.
 *
 * Leave any optional field out and the card picks a tasteful, consistent
 * style for you automatically. The result is meant to look hand signed:
 * wonky, varied and individual.
